# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Every email that lands in a shared inbox gets assigned to a person, tracked to response, and never falls through the cracks.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Dashboard (in progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (Dashboard)
Plan: 1 of N in current phase (03-01 done)
Status: Phase 3 in progress
Last activity: 2026-03-11 -- Plan 03-01 executed (email dashboard list view with HTMX filtering)

Progress: [#####.....] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 6.2 min
- Total execution time: 0.62 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | 12 min | 6 min |
| 2. Email Pipeline | 3 | 17 min | 5.7 min |
| 3. Dashboard | 1 | 9 min | 9 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (3 min), 02-01 (6 min), 02-02 (7 min), 02-03 (4 min), 03-01 (9 min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Django 5.2 LTS + HTMX + Tailwind CSS (single container, no React/Node)
- Auth: Simple password auth for v1 (Google OAuth deferred to v2)
- Scheduler: APScheduler as separate management command process (not inside Gunicorn)
- PDF: Swap PyMuPDF (AGPL) for pypdf (BSD)
- Python 3.13 venv required for Django 5.2 (system Python 3.9.6 too old)
- SQLite for local dev/tests, PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL in production
- User model stub in Task 1 to set AUTH_USER_MODEL before first migration
- Single container (Django+Gunicorn) with host PostgreSQL via extra_hosts, port 8100:8000
- SSH deploy via appleboy/ssh-action, tag-triggered (same pattern as v1)
- Nginx listen 80 only, certbot adds SSL post-deploy
- SystemConfig inherits TimestampedModel only (not SoftDeleteModel)
- Spam filter category="Spam" (not "General Inquiry" like v1)
- TriageResult DTO simplified: dropped raw_response/success/error from v1
- StateManager SLA tracking deferred to Phase 4
- AIProcessor takes explicit api_key param (not env var) for testability
- Spam filter called by pipeline orchestrator, not AIProcessor (separation of concerns)
- Pipeline is the ONLY module with Django ORM imports (GmailPoller/AIProcessor Django-agnostic)
- Heartbeat not_started (no heartbeat) = healthy, stale (old heartbeat) = degraded
- ChatNotifier takes Django Email model instances (not dicts) for cleaner integration
- Tailwind v4 CDN + HTMX 2.0 CDN for zero build step (no Node.js)
- request.htmx partial detection for SPA-like behavior without SPA complexity
- Admin default=unassigned queue, member default=own emails
- ActivityLog model inherits TimestampedModel only (append-only, not soft-delete)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VM audit needed before Phase 1 deployment: Docker setup, Nginx config, PostgreSQL version, available resources
- Production Sheet data audit needed before migration (if migration phase added later)
