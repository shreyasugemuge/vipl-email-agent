## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Django 5.2 LTS + HTMX + Tailwind CSS (single container, no React/Node)
- Auth: Simple password auth for v1 (Google OAuth deferred to v2)
- Scheduler: APScheduler as separate management command process (not inside Gunicorn)
- PDF: Swap PyMuPDF (AGPL) for pypdf (BSD)

### Pending Todos

- Production Sheet data audit needed before migration (if migration phase added later)
